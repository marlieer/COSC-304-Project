# COSC-304-Project

    Hello everybody! I just figured out github pretty good! So I've created a branch for all of you, and here's what you're going to do with it... (also, the preview of this text doesn't include the tabs and linefeeds, so it'll look pretty clumped until you open it)
    1.) clone the URI and using Eclipse, import the project into Eclipse
    2.) there is a branch available for each of you. It's your first name all lower case
    3.) when you make changes to the code, commit AND PUSH them to YOUR branch ONLY! Not anyone else's branch and NOT the master branch
    4.) you can't approve to merge your own file to the master. Other members need to.
    
    For example, I've pushed 2 commits. One with a simple comment, and one where I've created a DinoCo project folder with different packages. To view this, go to the header "Pull requests" and you should be able to see what I've pushed through my branch. You'll be able to merge my changes into the master branch. Merging to the master isn't really undo-able. I think there's a way, but it's messy.
    
    The key is to ONLY work via your own branch, and NEVER work on a class someone else is working on. Keep to your own tasks.
